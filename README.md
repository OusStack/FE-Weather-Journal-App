# Weather Journal App :umbrella:

## Overview
This project was tied in with working with Web APIs and offbeat code, making a web application that utilizes OpenWeatherMap API to get climate dependent on the client's area, and progressively update UI. 

## Instructions
This will require modifying the `server.js` file and the `website/app.js` file. You can see `index.html` for element references, and once you are finished with the project steps, you can use `style.css` to style your application to customized perfection.

## Building
To get the project up and running I followed these steps:

Setting up project environment, making sure I have Node and packages installed, and included in my server.js file.
Added POST and GET routes to ensure correct retrieval of data from the server.
Acquired API credentials from OpenWeatherMap website.
Created async functions to fetch weather data and store it on my local server.
Set up a function that updated UI dynamically.

## More extra info
If you are interested in testing your code as you go, you can use `tests.js` as a template for writing and running some basic tests for your code.
